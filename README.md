# Derived-Tables-with-Subqueries
When your subquery yields a set of rows and columns as its output, you have the option to transform this data into a table-like structure 
by incorporating it within a FROM clause. This resultant construct is referred to as a derived table, offering a convenient way to 
manipulate and work with the retrieved data in a more structured manner.
